# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Navigation App

Description: A web application that *simulates* a navigation experience with route planning, user-generated reports, points of interest, and promotions. It focuses on providing a user-friendly interface and mock data to showcase the potential of a full-fledged navigation app.

Features:

*   Mock Map Display:
    *   Users can select between 2D road map and satellite views.
    *   The map displays the user's location (mocked) with a customizable icon.
    *   Users can switch between North-up and direction-of-travel-up orientations.
*   Route Planning:
    *   Users can define a start and end point and add waypoints.
    *   The app displays a mock route on the map.
*   User-Generated Reports:
    *   Users can submit mock reports on road conditions and hazards.
    *   Reports are displayed as icons on the map.
    *   Users can "edit" existing reports (mock functionality).
*   Points of Interest (POIs):
    *   The map displays mock POIs with icons (e.g., camping grounds, restaurants).
    *   Clicking on a POI displays basic information and a link to a website (mock).
*   Promotions:
    *   Extra icons for promoted services (accommodation, camping, etc.).
    *   Pop-up ads for vendors along the user's mock route (limited to one per 50km, excluding the start/end 5km).
*   Trip Log: A mock trip log that recreates the last "trip" with timestamps and stop periods.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
